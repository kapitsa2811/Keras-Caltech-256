#Conclusion

As seen in the table above using a Convolutional Neural Network is a big leap in accuracy from Fully Connected Neural Networks and Transfer learning of is a significantly better than training a CNN from scratch. Furthermore, Transfer Learning is the fastest to train because you are only training a fraction of the network and in addition, it requires the least data.
